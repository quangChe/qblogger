# Q Blogger

Q Blogger is a general blog site that I made while learning to use a NoSQL database--specifically MongoDB. 
Node.js with Express were also used to provide route handling. The app is current running [here](https://qblogger.herokuapp.com/)
using Heroku as a server host and MongoLab as the database host.
